In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, a common issue is encountering unexpected behavior or errors when dealing with data types other than strings. AsyncStorage only supports storing strings; attempting to store objects directly might lead to unexpected behavior, especially when retrieving the data. The retrieved data may appear as a stringified object, requiring parsing to use it correctly.  For example, storing a JavaScript object directly will result in a string representation being saved, not the object itself.  Failure to parse this string before use would lead to runtime issues.
